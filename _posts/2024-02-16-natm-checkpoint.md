### Glows
- Our backend/frontend integration was good, and there was a lot of stuff to show
- Login system worked well, videos uploaded fast and genres and search features added a lot
- UI was clean and professional

### Growths
- Our project(youtube style video sharing site) was only interesting with a lot of user interaction, and it wasn't super captivating
- There were a few bugs and quality of life things that needed to be added(full search functionality, feedback on upload success/failure)
- There were suggestions for some cool features(comments on videos, channel pages for each user, likes/dislikes, etc.)

I saw many projects at N@TM, including one with a mario game, messaging chat, and a camera feed between two computers. I could tell that people put a lot of effort into these projects, and particularly the live video feed was incredibly impressive. A lot of impressive projects, like a pokemon remake, were from CSA students, whoch made me more interested in doing CSA next year. The overall mood and atmosphere of the night was very nice, with people excited about showcasing their projects and lots of people chatting.
