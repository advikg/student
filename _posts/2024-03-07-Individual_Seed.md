# Qualifications for Individual Seed

- CPT Project: 
    - [Frontend](https://github.com/Napoleon-Bonaparte-Official/corsica-frontend)
    - [Backend](https://github.com/Napoleon-Bonaparte-Official/corsica-backend)
- Feature is video upload using POST, with video file along with 
- Future Improvements:
    - Smoother upload, more feedback during upload(progress bar for larger files, "Upload Successful!" message, etc.)

# Contribution to Team
Team was very well-balanced, so much so that it was kind of surprising. Me, Will, Aashray, and Yeongsu all did equal parts of work in different areas(backend api, backend model/db, cors, frontend fetch, frontend functionality, styling, etc.).
We had many communications through slack and discord, and frequent meetings/calls to check on progress. I contributed a lot myself as shown in the Github analytics:

# Team Planning/Ideation
Trimester 2 has quite a bit of work on ideation, since we had not only the CPT project but the binary CPT warmup.

# AP Work
I have gotten decently high scores on my CB MCQs that we've done in class, but on questions I've gotten wrong I have researched and understood my mistakes in order to learn and prepare for the AP exam. I have also learned and understood the format/criteria for the CPT project.
